Circular Economy: There is a focus on supporting circular economy models in tourism, including reducing waste, using renewable energy, and supporting local businesses. Carbon Footprint Reduction: Actions are taken to reduce the carbon footprint in business operations and implement measures to validate and evaluate sustainability efforts. Education and Capacity Building: Initiatives include knowledge-sharing events on tourism education, circular economy, and sustainable practices. There is also an emphasis on training programs, both for employees and tourism stakeholders, to develop necessary skills. Investment in Sustainable Solutions: Efforts are made to identify, mentor, and invest in companies and innovations that contribute to sustainable mobility, circular economy, and green transition in tourism. Digitalization: The cluster addresses the role of digital technologies in promoting sustainability, with a focus on digital solutions, digital marketing, and online booking systems. Support for SMEs: Actions involve providing technical and financial support to tourism SMEs for green transition, digital transformation, and overall sustainability. Cooperation and Networking: Collaboration is emphasized, including engagement with Smart Destination Networks, cooperation projects, and partnerships with educational organizations. Accessing Funding Opportunities: There is a commitment to assisting tourism actors in accessing funding opportunities, disseminating information about funding programs, and developing proposals. Overall, the cluster reflects a comprehensive approach to fostering sustainability in the tourism sector, encompassing various dimensions such as environmental conservation, community engagement, circular economy practices, and the integration of digital technologies.\"\n",
    "Cluster6 = \"The pledges of Cluster 6 cover a wide range of topics, including the development of sustainable tourism strategies, the implementation of sustainable tourism policies, the promotion of sustainable tourism offers, the adoption of sustainable tourism practices, the measurement and reduction of the ecological footprint of tourism, the protection of natural heritage and biodiversity, and the facilitation of intermodal transport solutions. The ultimate goal of these pledges is to achieve a more sustainable, resilient, and digital tourism industry.\""
